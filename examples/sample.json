But new research shows that the leave-taking process of the outgoing chief executive is often mishandled, with negative impacts on succession and the organization.

The researchers share stories from the front lines about CEO psychology, best practices for outgoing leaders and their boards, and broader lessons for effective transitions. Jerusalim and Kwok wrote the HBR article \"The Vital Role of the Outgoing CEO.\""
