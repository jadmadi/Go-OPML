But by the early 2010s, the public company suffered a series of product missteps, negative media scrutiny, and challenging partner relationships. In late 2015, the company was acquired by JAB Holding Company. The new CEO Bob Gamgort first strengthened partnerships, raised productivity, and reduced costs. In 2017, the company then focused on new growth. Gamgort considered four major options: take the company public again through an IPO; set out for greater global expansion; combine with another coffee business to become a larger player in North American coffee; or diversify beyond coffee through a “pure play beverage” strategy. In this conversation, HBS Senior Lecturer David Fubini and Research Associate Patrick Sanguineti discuss the four strategic options from their case study, “Keurig: A Return to Growth.”"

        "description": "In a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, government funding cuts, and AI that can outperform humans, many people are rightly worried about how those forces might disrupt their careers. Layoffs loom, and even those in senior leadership might soon experience - or have already endured - a setback they weren't expecting. Whitney Johnson, the CEO of Disruption Advisors, has advice on how to deal with the emotions surrounding those kinds of shocks, tactical steps you can take to get back in the game, and ways to learn from the experience so you're better positioned for the future."

But Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO of Amazon from legendary founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, manages in a way that he says helps him stay focused on what is best for their products and ultimately their customers. He explains his decision to get workers back to the office five days a week, why he is building an organization less dependent on managers, and how their artificial intelligence strategy differs from the rest."

In the case of space, there is still a strong need for public-private collaboration. But as costs drop to reach space, more private-sector companies can enter the market. Matthew Weinzierl is a senior associate dean and professor at Harvard Business School, and Brendan Rosseau is a strategy manager at Blue Origin. They explain the evolving role of the U.S. government to foster innovation and competition as the space economy increasingly privatizes. They also identify the emerging opportunities for businesses and individuals. Weinzierl and Rosseau are authors of the book Space to Grow: Unlocking the Final Economic Frontier."

Indeed, 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies had immigrant founders. While most research focuses on why these people launched their businesses, perhaps more interesting is how they achieved lasting success. Neri Karra Sillaman is an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University and the founder of luxury leather goods company Neri Karra. She's studied these entrepreneurs and shares her findings, which offer lessons for anyone in the corporate world.

        "description": "Welcome to the PMO Strategies Podcast + Blog, where PMO leaders become IMPACT Drivers!\n\n\n\n\n PMI Talent Triangle: Power Skills\n\n\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, Apple was struggling. Co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company, recognizing that he couldn’t rescue Apple on his own. So, he did what all smart leaders do—he asked for help. Jobs persuaded Tim Cook to join Apple, and the rest is history. Cook's operational expertise transformed Apple, streamlining its supply chain and ultimately paving the way for the iconic products we know today.\n \nThis story highlights a key point: even visionary leaders like Jobs need help to succeed.\n \nIn this week’s episode of the PMO Strategies Podcast, I sit down with executive coach and storyteller Deepak Daniel to discuss why asking for help is not a weakness, but a superpower that leaders can use to unlock their full potential.\n \nThe Courage to Ask for Help\nOne of the most challenging hurdles leaders face is overcoming the fear of asking for help. Many leaders, particularly those in high-stakes roles, often feel the pressure to know everything. This is especially true when their reputation and success seem to depend on always having the answers. But as Deepak shares in this episode, that mindset can hinder your success.\n \nLeaders who ask for help when needed, collaborate with others, and seek guidance build stronger teams, achieve bigger results, and gain respect. In fact, failing to ask for help can lead to burnout, missed opportunities, and, worse, project failure.\n \nWhy Don’t Leaders Ask for Help?\nDeepak and I dive into the reasons why leaders—whether they're in the boardroom or on the sports field—hesitate to ask for help. Whether it's fear of appearing incompetent, imposter syndrome, or overconfidence, these mental blocks can severely limit a leader's ability to succeed.\n \nHow Asking for Help Makes You a Better Leader\nDuring our discussion, Deepak shares powerful strategies to shift your mindset around help-seeking. Leaders who are humble enough to acknowledge when they need assistance are the ones who lead with resilience, adaptability, and strength. By embracing this vulnerability, you open up a world of possibilities, including better problem-solving and stronger team dynamics.\n \nKey Takeaways from the Episode:\n💡 Strategic Insights: Even top executives don’t have all the answers, and that’s okay. Learn how asking for help can unlock the door to better business outcomes.\n \n🎓 Expert Advice: Practical ways to navigate imposter syndrome, overcome the fear of asking for help, and leverage the power of collaboration.\n \n🛠️ Actionable Tips: Step-by-step strategies to build trusted relationships, ask for help effectively, and track your progress toward becoming a more effective leader.\n \nAs Deepak wisely points out, \"The power of asking for help is about building trust and relationships—it’s a team game, and you cannot win alone.\"\n \nTake the Next Step\nIf you’re ready to make a bigger IMPACT, it’s time to stop going it alone. Tune into this week’s episode and learn how to start asking for help, lead more effectively, and drive the outcomes that matter most.\n \nFor more insights on elevating your leadership, grab your copy of The IMPACT Engine and become part of the IMPACT Insider community, where you’ll gain access to exclusive tools and resources to help you lead with confidence.\n \n🎧 Ready to learn more?

        "description": "Welcome to the PMO Strategies Podcast + Blog, where PMO leaders become IMPACT Drivers!\n\n\n\n\n PMI Talent Triangle: Power Skills\n\n\n\nIn a world where project teams juggle multiple roles, deadlines, and evolving business needs, finding a leadership approach that truly connects with team members is essential. Enter Servant Leadership as a Service—an innovative leadership model that combines empathy, the platinum rule, and agile-inspired tools from software development to foster a people-centered approach. This concept, developed by Eric Ruder, Senior Project Manager at the American Marketing Association, treats team members as primary customers, addressing their individual needs to cultivate engagement, growth, and productivity.\n \nThe Origins of Servant Leadership as a Service\nThe idea of Servant Leadership as a Service stemmed from Eric’s work with tech leaders and developers who often struggle to find a leadership approach that resonates with both people-oriented and process-driven team members. Many leaders in tech are already familiar with user stories, agile cycles, and human-centered design. Eric’s insight was to apply these tools, not to software, but to people.\n \n“Instead of writing a user story for software, you’re writing a user story for an employee facing a challenge,” Eric explains. This approach allows leaders to use familiar tools to support their team members’ growth, while also fostering a customer-service mindset focused on team members’ well-being.\n \nWhy the Platinum Rule is Essential to Servant Leadership as a Service\nCentral to this approach is the platinum rule: “Do unto others as they would like to have done unto them.” Unlike the golden rule, which assumes everyone’s preferences are the same, the platinum rule requires leaders to understand each team member’s unique needs and preferences.\n \nA simple analogy Eric shares involves bringing coffee for the team. While well-intentioned, not everyone may drink coffee—some may prefer tea or water. By focusing on the platinum rule, leaders cater to individual needs, fostering a deeper connection with their team. This shift allows leaders to prioritize what team members need to feel supported and valued, rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all approach.\n \nKey Tools and Benefits of Servant Leadership as a Service\nHere are some practical methods for implementing Servant Leadership as a Service, along with their benefits:\n\nUser Stories for Team Development\nTraditionally used in software development, user stories outline a feature or task without prescribing a solution, leaving space for creative problem-solving. Leaders can apply this concept to employees, documenting challenges or goals and encouraging team members to collaborate on solutions. This approach fosters autonomy and innovation within the team.\nEmpathy Mapping for Insightful Understanding\nEmpathy mapping, a staple in human-centered design, helps leaders understand the perspectives of their team members by asking questions such as:\n\nWhat are they seeing and hearing?\nWhat challenges are they experiencing?\nWhat are their professional and personal goals?\n\n\nThis exercise builds a comprehensive view of team dynamics and motivations, fostering objectivity by treating everyone equally. For teams struggling with trust, anonymous empathy mapping can be particularly effective.\nHuman-Centered Design for Leadership Iteration\nHuman-centered design encourages an iterative approach to leadership, treating each interaction as an opportunity for improvement. Leaders can experiment with new engagement techniques, gather feedback, and adapt their strategies based on the results. This keeps leadership flexible and responsive to team needs, similar to a product development cycle.\n“What’s on Your Radar?” Exercise for Team Alignment\nThis exercise allows team members to share their priorities in real-time, categorizing tasks as urgent, mid-term, or long-term. By centering the agenda on what’s important to each team member,"

The feast and famine cycle—where you’re either overloaded with projects or scrambling to find work—is a common issue many freelancers face. In episode 285 of the PMO Strategies Podcast, Candice Benson, CEO of Benson Consulting Inc., shares strategies to break this cycle.\n \nWith over 25 years of experience in project management, change management, and process improvement, Candice offers practical tools to help freelance PMs and contractors maintain consistent project pipelines and build a sustainable business.\n \nThe Three Critical Tools for Success\n🔎 Visibility\nCandice emphasizes the importance of making yourself visible in the marketplace. A capability statement—similar to a resume but focused on your freelance work—is a great way to showcase your expertise and projects. It highlights your successes and gives potential clients a clear picture of what you bring to the table.\nRegular updates on platforms like LinkedIn can also increase visibility. Share project wins, client testimonials, or lessons learned to keep your name at the forefront of potential clients’ minds.\n📊 Sales Process \u0026 Framework\nMany freelance PMs struggle with the sales aspect of their business. Candice advises having a defined process for managing leads, nurturing relationships, and following up with potential clients. A clear sales framework helps you stay organized and ensures that you don’t miss out on opportunities.\nProactively setting boundaries for your sales process also ensures you’re working with clients who respect your time and expertise.\n💡 Community \u0026 Continuous Learning\nFreelancers often feel isolated, but Candice stresses the importance of community. Engaging with a network of fellow PMs and contractors provides opportunities to learn, collaborate, and share resources. Building relationships within the project management community also opens doors to potential partnerships and projects, helping to maintain a steady workflow.\n🎯 Overcoming Imposter Syndrome\nCandice also discusses a common challenge for freelancers: imposter syndrome. As a freelancer, it’s easy to doubt your value when you’re competing for work. Candice advises leaning into your strengths and leveraging the experiences you gained in full-time roles. By showcasing your expertise and reminding yourself of past successes, you can overcome self-doubt and build confidence.\n \nKey Takeaways\n🔎 Increase Your Visibility: Use a capability statement and social platforms like LinkedIn to stay visible and top-of-mind with potential clients.\n📈 Build a Sales Framework: Establish a structured process for prospecting, client engagement, and follow-up to close more deals.\n🤝 Leverage Community: Engage with your PM network to collaborate, learn, and avoid isolation.\n \n🎧 Press play above to listen to the full episode and learn how to build a thriving freelance PM business.\n \n\n \n\n\nConnect with Candice Benson\nConnect on LinkedIn\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nP.S.

In Episode 284 of the PMO Strategies Podcast, Tao Chun Lu and Laura Bernard discuss how integrating AI with Agile methodologies allows PMOs to automate routine tasks, improve resource allocation, and enable project managers to focus on high-impact, strategic decisions. This article provides actionable insights from the podcast to help PMOs leverage AI and Agile for streamlined operations and enhanced decision-making.\n \nWhy AI is Essential for the Modern PMO\nToday, AI isn’t just a trendy tool—it’s a fundamental asset for PMOs looking to stay ahead. Tao explains that AI allows PMOs to predict potential project bottlenecks, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance overall decision-making. However, integrating AI into project management isn’t about replacing human roles; instead, it’s about automating routine tasks so project managers can focus on leadership, stakeholder engagement, and strategic impact.\n \nAI can transform administrative tasks, such as data collection and report generation, into automated processes, freeing up time for project managers to engage with stakeholders and develop creative solutions. With AI handling “the numbers,” PMOs can dedicate resources to more people-centric activities, driving a culture of collaboration and innovation.\n \nTraditional AI and Generative AI – A Perfect Partnership\nTao emphasizes the importance of understanding both Traditional AI and Generative AI and leveraging each type’s strengths:\n \n\nTraditional AI excels in data analytics, pattern recognition, and predictive insights. It’s invaluable for tasks such as resource planning, budget forecasting, and project timeline estimation.\nGenerative AI, a newer form of AI, shines in qualitative tasks, such as drafting stakeholder communications, generating creative ideas, and analyzing feedback for hidden insights. For PMOs, Generative AI can assist in project ideation, write client emails, and even summarize retrospectives.\n\n \nThe integration of both types enables PMOs to combine quantitative analysis with qualitative insights, creating a balanced approach that supports both the analytical and creative aspects of project management.\n \nIntegrating AI with Agile for Greater Efficiency\nThe integration of AI with Agile methodologies allows PMOs to accelerate project timelines and optimize workflow. Here’s Tao’s recommended three-step approach:\n \n\nStart with Traditional AI for Data-Heavy Tasks: AI can automate data-driven tasks like sprint planning, backlog prioritization, and resource allocation. Leveraging Traditional AI for these tasks ensures that teams have a solid data foundation before moving into more nuanced applications.\nIntroduce Generative AI for Qualitative Tasks: Generative AI can be used to analyze team feedback, identify patterns, and generate creative ideas. By deploying Generative AI in retrospective analysis and stakeholder communication, PMOs can uncover valuable insights that inform Agile processes.\n\n \nTrain and Engage Your Team: Engage the team in each step, allowing them to test AI tools during Agile standups or retrospectives. Encourage feedback on how AI enhances or disrupts their workflows, and incorporate their insights into the integration process.\n \nThrough this gradual integration, PMOs can merge AI with Agile in a way that feels natural, maximizing efficiency without overwhelming the team.\n \nOvercoming Challenges in AI Integration\nResistance to AI is common in any organization, particularly when concerns arise around job displacement or data security. Tao offers these tips to help PMOs address these challenges:\n \n\nEmphasize AI as a Support Tool: Reassure your team that A..."

He says leaders should instead reevaluate their pricing strategy—or develop one for the first time—to better respond to customers during the slump and keep them when the economy recovers. \r\n\r\nSince this conversation took place in 2020, the crisis you'll hear them referring to is—obviously—the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mohammed shares examples of companies across a variety of industries that created effective price strategies in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. \r\n\r\nMohammed is the author of \"The 1% Windfall: How Successful Companies Use Price to Profit and Grow\" and the recent HBR article, “Setting a Pricing Strategy Amid Ever-Changing Tariffs.\""

        "description": "\u003cp\u003eCosts proper to the employer, meaning expenses which are incurred by employees in the context of their employment agreement and then reimbursed by the employer, has become a “hot topic” recently due to a legislative change. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn practice, the reimbursement of such costs can be made on the basis of actual expenses or on basis of monthly lump sum allowances that cover these expenses. If settled correctly, this kind of reimbursement is advantageous for both the employee and the employer. For the employee the reimbursment is in principle free of tax and social security contributions. For the employer, as the reimbursement does not qualify as “salary”, no employer social security contributions are due.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDue to the recent legislative change, we can expect more audits (from the tax and the social authorities) of these reimbursement of costs “proper to the employer”. Therefore, it is essential to be prepared in case of an audit and to assess, as an employer, the quality of the internal cost policy.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDuring this podcast our experts Olivier Chapelle, Ingrid Kinet and Gauthier Vael  will tackle the different aspects to be taken into consideration when implementing such a costs reimbursement policy. Indeed, as the social security authorities and the tax authorities sometimes have different positions on the same question, it is essential to adopt a pluridisciplinary approach.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eA well-implemented costs reimbursement policy reduces the risk of rejection of reimbursement as “costs proper to the employer”.
